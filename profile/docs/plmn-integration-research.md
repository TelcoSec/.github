## Attack Scenarios & Mitigations

### Scenario 1: Cross-RAT Downgrade Attack
```plaintext
Attack Flow:
1. Attacker sets up rogue base station
2. Forces UE to perform inter-RAT handover
3. Exploits weaker security in legacy RAT
4. Intercepts unprotected traffic

Mitigation:
- Implement strict security policy during handover
- Enable RAN security features
- Monitor for suspicious handover patterns
- Deploy RAT-specific security controls
```

### Scenario 2: Roaming Interface Exploitation
```plaintext
Attack Flow:
1. Attacker compromises IPX connection
2. Injects malicious Diameter/SS7 messages
3. Bypasses home routing
4. Gains unauthorized access to subscriber data

Mitigation:
- Deploy signaling firewalls
- Implement IPX security monitoring
- Use secure GRX/IPX providers
- Enable origin validation
```
